    "### Answer:\n",
    "ASCII is an early character encoding system that uses 7 bits with 128 possible characters and only works for basic English. \n",
    "Unicode is a modern character encoding standard that aims to represent every character in every language, such that it \n",
    "uses variable length encoding (can be 8, 16, or 32 bits) depending on the encoding (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unicode was developed because ACII was too limited, such that the latter fails to represent accented letters and non-Latin languages. \n",
    "ASCII was designed primarily for English and cannot represent characters from languages such as Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, or Russian. \n",
    "Unicode provides a unified standard that allows all of these languages, and more, to be represented in the same system. \n",
    "This universality ensures that text can be shared and displayed correctly across different computers, software, and platforms worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unicode is also backward compatible with ASCII. The first 128 Unicode characters are identical to the ASCII set, which means that older ASCII text files remain valid under Unicode. \n",
    "Additionally, Unicode’s use of variable-length encodings (such as UTF-8) provides flexibility, allowing it to efficiently store English text while still being capable of encoding more complex characters when needed. \n",
    "Overall, Unicode solves the limitations of ASCII, enables global communication, and supports modern text and symbols, making it essential for today’s digital world."

    "### Answer:\n",
    "Von Neumann architecture is a classic computer design in which both program instructions and data are stored in the same memory and accessed by a CPU. The CPU includes a control unit and an arithmetic logic unit, and it communicates with memory and input/output devices through a shared bus. Its significance lies in the stored-program concept, which allows computers to be easily reprogrammed and has shaped the design of most modern general-purpose computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Von Neumann bottleneck is the performance limitation caused by the CPU and memory sharing a single communication path. Since instructions and data must travel over the same bus, the CPU can be forced to wait for memory access, slowing execution. Although techniques like caching and pipelining reduce this problem, the bottleneck remains a fundamental challenge in computer performance."

    "### Answer:\n",
    "Low-level and high-level programming languages differ mainly in how close they are to machine hardware vs. human language. Low-level languages, such as machine code (binary instructions executed directly by the CPU) and assembly language (mnemonics closely representing machine instructions), provide minimal abstraction and give programmers fine-grained control over hardware resources like memory and registers. These languages are useful when you need high performance, precise timing, or direct hardware interaction—for example in operating system kernels, embedded systems, or device drivers—but they are harder to write, read, and maintain because the programmer must manage many details manually. \n",
    "\n",
    "High-level languages like Python and Java sit much further from hardware, offering strong abstraction with features such as automatic memory management, clear syntax, and rich libraries that simplify complex tasks for developers. These languages are typically chosen for application development, rapid prototyping, data analysis, and web programming because they make code easier to write and port across different systems. The trade-off is that high-level languages may introduce some performance overhead compared with low-level code, but they greatly speed up development and reduce bugs."

    "Discuss the concept of abstraction in computer science, using the representation of images in computers as an example. How does this abstraction process impact data analysis and predictive modelling in image-related tasks?"
   ]
  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Answer:\n",
    "Abstraction in computer science refers to hiding unnecessary details to focus on higher-level concepts, allowing programmers and systems to work without knowing all the low-level mechanics. For example, computers represent images not as pictures humans see but as grids of pixels stored as numerical values (e.g., color components stored as bits). At the lowest level, each pixel’s data is just bits in memory; higher levels of abstraction let us think of images as objects we can display, edit, or analyze without worrying about underlying storage. This process of abstraction is crucial in data analysis and predictive modeling involving images: models need to operate on numerical representations of pixels or features derived from them rather than raw pictures. By abstracting images into arrays of numbers, algorithms can detect patterns, learn from data, and make predictions (e.g., classifying objects in images) without human intervention in how pixels are stored. Effective abstraction thus bridges human concepts (like “cat” or “edge”) and machine representations, making complex tasks tractable and enabling powerful image-based analysis."
